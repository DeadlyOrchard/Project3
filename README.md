# The Problem
- The scenario given for the problem is a grocer wanting to track how many products of each product type are being sold each day.
- Rather than tediously giving the computer input throughout the day, the grocer wants a program that reads from a .txt file (a list of sold products) to find this information.
- To ensure the data gathered by the program is not corrupted or lost, the grocer also wants the program to create a file to backup the data on the hard drive.
